# StuDIY
StuDIY is a collaborative platform for students to shade study materials and engage in dicussions systematically and effectively.

## Motivation
We are sure all students, regardless of their faculty or year of study, have been met with the situation where the study material provided by the professors of the module is insufficient, and they require additional notes or practice exercises. As a result, students reach out to seniors or friends requesting for the material they have received during their iteration of that particular module, who more often than not have already deleted them. 

Wouldn’t it be much more efficient and effective if students do not have to go around asking for study material, but instead have access to a treasure trove of data that contains large quantities of material from previous iterations of the module? 

We also feel that sometimes students might be apprehensive when it comes to asking questions they may have, in fear of asking “dumb questions”. Although there currently exist forums for each individual module, they are often not fully utilized.  It would be great if we could create a safe environment where current and past students, as well as professors and teacher assistants can have meaningful discussions.

## Aim
We hope to bring to students an online platform where they have access to a wide variety of materials and additional help from previous iterations of the module. We also hope that this platform will encourage students to be more proactive in discussing questions and problems encountered throughout the module.

## User Stories
* As a student who often requires additional study material to better understand the module, I want to have access to more materials for the module whenever I require it. 
* As a student who is studying for my exams, I would like to have the answers to all the past year papers I am doing.
* As a student, I am often afraid to ask questions directly during the lecture. Therefore, it would be great to have a forum where I could clarify my doubts (possibly anonymously).
* As a student, some of the current websites where we can access past year papers (e.g. Appbox) are very cluttered and unmaintained. It would be good if there is an admin to moderate and make it easy for anyone to quickly access the content they are looking for.

## Scope of Project
Our web app will allow students to *upload and download relevant study material*, which will be organised according to module code and iteration of the module. 

There will also be a *forum* where students can *post questions* that they might have, which can be *answered quickly* by anyone. 

## Features

## How are we different from other platforms?
1. iVLE / LumiNUS
  1. Students only have access to materials that have been uploaded by the professor, which might be insufficient sometimes.
  2. The forum provided might also be ineffective as most questions can only be answered by a limited number of people with the knowledge, such as the professor or the teaching assistants. It might also take some time before students’ questions get answered. 


2. Quora/StackOverFlow/StackExchange
  1. Sometimes the questions asked by students may be pertaining to a certain tutorial or exam paper question, and it is difficult to provide the context of the questions on those websites. 
  2. There is also no clear organisation of the topics of the questions asked, which results in the same question being asked several times.
